<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fluorinating Reagents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electrophilic Fluorinating Reagents</li><li>Nucleophilic Fluorinating Reagents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fluorinating reagents market is primarily divided into two types: electrophilic and nucleophilic fluorinating reagents. Electrophilic fluorinating reagents introduce fluorine into organic molecules by acting as electron acceptors, enhancing reactivity through electrophilic attacks. Examples include compounds such as N-fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) and Selectfluor. Nucleophilic fluorinating reagents, on the other hand, donate fluorine to substrates as electron donors, often involving alkali metal fluorides and other nucleophilic species. Both types are essential for various applications in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials science.</p></p>
